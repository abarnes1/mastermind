# mastermind

A console version of Mastermind written in Ruby as part of The Odin Project curriculum.  Can you create a code that the computer can't break? (No... but it does a lot of math very quickly.)

Key learning concepts:
 1. Encapsulation: 
   a. The secret code can't accessed while the game is running.
   b. Private variables for each turn results can be read but not changed.
 2. Class design: 
   a. Separate classes for game state, game logic, game display, and human/computer code breakers.
   b. Experimented with class functions where state was not important.  (MastermindPrinter class,  Mastermind.valid_code? function)
 3. Enumeration methods
   a. A lot of practice while creating this game.
 4. Array methods
   a.  Learned about repeated_permutation method which saved a ton of time and a messy code block.
   b.  Using & operator to intersect two arrays.
 5. Use of Rubocop linter for (mostly) consistent code style.
